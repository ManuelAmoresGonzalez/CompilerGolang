Compiler for Golang in C #


A compiler created for a small part of the grammar of the Golang language and implemented in its entirety in the C # language, was called MiniGo, in this project specific libraries were used for the implementation of Compilers such as ANTLR4, this was used for the creation of the parser and the scanner of the project as well as the creation of the visitors necessary to cover the project.
In addition to this, LLVMSharp is used, which helps to implement code generation.
In this project you will find a complete structure of syntactic analysis, as well as error handling and code execution.
